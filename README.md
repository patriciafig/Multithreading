> **Specifications of the Program** 

 * Create a separate worker thread to compute each row of the result matrix, instead of a thread for each element.
 * Do not initialize the contents of the A and B matrices statically. The A and B matrices will be initialized by reading data from an input file (see notes below).
 * Be able to process multiple sets of input matrices by continuing to read data in the specified format (described below). If any other character than an integer including negative number is specified, output an error message and terminate the program with a non-zero return code.
 *  Each set of data processed must be labeled to indicate which set of data is being output (e.g.,Matrix A,Matrix B, etc).
 *  Maximum size of Matrices can be 10000x10000

Name:  main.cpp
   Main program.  
   This is the driver program that calls functions
   to read data from an input file, use the data make a new file,
   and print an output.

*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.
   The program was developed and tested on CLion 2017.1.1 and on csegrid.  It was compiled, run, and tested on macOS Sierra.

*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.
   To uncompress it use the following commands
       % unzip [PatriciaFigLab01]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [PatriciaFigLab01]

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
